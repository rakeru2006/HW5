## Description
:bulb:
  ***

Simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for 
each hour of the work hours  day . 



## User Story

```



## Usage
:speech_balloon:  :hammer: :eyeglasses:
  ***
We are going to create this code to show, help and Learn

This app run in the browser and feature dynamically
updated 
```
HTML
CSS 
jQuery.

```
We use [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.
Moment.js is a free and open source JavaScript library that removes the need to use the native JavaScript Date object directly. 
The library is a wrapper for the Date object (in the same way that jQuery is a wrapper for JavaScript) making the object
a whole lot easier to work with.

## Installation

Small description step by step that tells how to run and develop the aplication

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (orange), present (yellow), or future (green)
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.
