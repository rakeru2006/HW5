## Description
:bulb:
  ***

Simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for 
each hour of the work hours  day . 




## Usage
:speech_balloon:  :hammer: :eyeglasses:
  ***
We are going to create this code to show, help and Learn

This app run in the browser and feature dynamically
updated 
```
HTML
CSS 
jQuery.

```
We use [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.
Moment.js is a free and open source JavaScript library that removes the need to use the native JavaScript Date object directly. 
The library is a wrapper for the Date object (in the same way that jQuery is a wrapper for JavaScript) making the object
a whole lot easier to work with.

## Installation
:feet:

Small description step by step that tells how to run and develop the aplication

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (orange), present (yellow), or future (green)
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
